# Salary Data
Currently this information is downloaded from [this site](https://prod.insights.georgia.gov/views/AverageAgencySalaryRateReport/SalaryAnalysis?%3AshowAppBanner=false&%3Adisplay_count=n&%3AshowVizHome=n&%3Aorigin=viz_share_link&%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y&%3Aembed=y).

I would love to find an automated way to download this CSV. But for now, I'm just going to download it manually and put it in this directory.
