# Meeting Cost Calc
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The goal of this project is to help calculate the cost of a meeting. It does so by calculating the length of the meeting * (sum of all hourly pays of attendees). The salary of employees can be difficult to obtain, unless you work for a state that share that information publicly. 


# General Next.JS Stuff Below
## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
